Stuff that don't always belong in the server:

- [KZ Server Advisor](https://bitbucket.org/kztimerglobalteam/kzserveradvisor): Required for global status submissions. Delete this when the process is done. See [here](https://forum.gokz.org/p/guide-whitelist) for global procedure.

- [Novis Everywhere](https://github.com/zer0k-z/Novis-Everywhere): Client-side script to enable novis without requiring sv_cheats 1. Useful if the player wants to noclip through the map.

- [bot-gloves](https://github.com/zer0k-z/bot-gloves): SourceMod plugin, adding gloves to bots. This is a stripped down version of kgn's gloves plugin, but is modified to work with bots instead. Designed for GOKZ video editors.

- [gokz-replays-speedtotext](https://bitbucket.org/zer0k_z/gokz-replays-speedtotext): Records bot speed and takeoff speed while playing a replay, then extracts it to `speed.txt` for video editors.

- bot_ws (Link needed): Add custom knife and pistols to bots. For video editors and LAN servers only, as this can invalidate your GSLT token too.

- [CMRSuppressor](https://github.com/zer0k-z/CMRSuppressor): Surpress CMultiplayRules constructor messages in console

- [tickrate_enabler_csgo](https://github.com/zer0k-z/tickrate_enabler_csgo): A tickrate enabler for CS:GO
